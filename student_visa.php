                <p class="left">The Student Visa (Subclass 500) enables foreign students to attend full-time
                    education in Australia in two regulated institutions: primary and secondary schools, vocational
                    education and training, universities, or other Institutions. This visa also allows students to
                    be accompanied by members of their families, which completes their education abroad.
                    <br><br>
                    It is usually for the duration of your course, up to five years. Some of the extensions can be
                    done if you want to further your education in a certain field. The base amount of the Student
                    Visa (Subclass 500) will cost $ 650, but this is without add-ons which include health and
                    character requirements, insurance and English tests.

                    <li> <strong>English Proficiency Tests:</strong> Tests that include funding fees are likely to
                        cost between AUD 300 to AUD 350.</li>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Student Visa Application Processing Time</h2>
                <p>
                    The decision time for the Student visa (Subclass 500) takes about 4-6 weeks, not including the
                    time you will take to collect your documents. The time taken can vary depending on factors such
                    as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The completeness of your application and the accuracy of the documents.</li>
                    <li> The type of program you are applying to and the school you are applying to.</li>
                    <li> The volume of work of immigration services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since the process is time-sensitive, it’s important to ensure that all documents are tendered as
                    and when they are needed. The submission of unabridged documents may create problems that result
                    in the processing authority calling for more information, which will, in the long run, take time
                    to process.
