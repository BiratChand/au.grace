                    <p>
                        With a Visitor Visa, you can do the following things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Visit your family or friends in Australia.</li>
                        <li> Visit Australia as a tourist. You can visit for a cruise or other purposes. However, you
                            cannot use it to visit for business purposes or medical treatment.</li>
                        <li> Train or study for a maximum of three months. However, a student visa is more suitable if
                            your primary motive of visiting Australia is for studies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> <strong>Please note that you cannot work in Australia under a visitor visa.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="text-center">How Long Can You Stay Under the Subclass 600 Visa?</h1><br>
                    <p class="left">As the visitor visa is a temporary visa, you can only stay for the duration listed
                        on your visa grant letter.
                        <br><br>
                        The length of your visa is finalized on a case-by-case basis. The following factors are taken
                        into account when deciding your stay period:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How long you want to stay in Australia.</li>
                        <li>The reason you want to visit Australia.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, it is possible that the authorities will not grant you the entire length of stay that you
                        apply for.
                        <br><br>
                        This visa may be issued with one or multiple entries. If you get a multiple-entry visa, you can
                        leave and return to Australia while the visa is valid. Usually, you can get a stay of three
                        months under this visa. However, in some exceptional circumstances, you can get a stay of up to
                        twelve months.
                        <br><br>
                        It is a criteria of this visa that you do not spend more than twelve months in Australia over
                        the course of an eighteen-month duration. If you already have a Visitor visa, a Working Holiday
                        visa, a Work and Holiday visa, or a bridging visa, and granting this visa would require you to
                        remain in Australia for more than twelve months, you must demonstrate exceptional circumstances.

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Processing Times</h2>
                    <p>
                        About seventy-five percent of applications are processed in about twenty-one days. Likewise,
                        ninety percent of the applications take thirty-five days to process.
                        <br><br>
                        If you fill your application incorrectly, then the processing will take even longer. Likewise,
                        in case of any missing documents and need for more information, the process will take longer.
                        Furthermore, the verification of your information will take time.

                    <p>
                        We recommend that you purchase health insurance to cover any unpredicted medical costs that you
                        can need while in Australia. During your stay in Australia, you are directly responsible for all
                        medical expenses. So, insurance will assist you in limiting your financial liabilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, Australia has reciprocal healthcare agreements with some countries. So, check if
                        your country has such agreements with Australia.

                    <p>
                        In case you get a visa with multiple entries, you can travel out of Australia and return. You
                        can check the specifications in your visa grant letter.
                        <br><br>
                        On the other hand, if you get a visa with a single entry, you can leave Australia, but you can’t
                        go back even if your visa duration is not over. So, you will need to apply for another visa to
                        go back to Australia.
