                    <h1>STEP BY STEP PROCEDURES FOR MIGRATION PROGRAM</h1>
                    <p>At Grace International, we’ve refined our migration process to ensure a smooth and stress-free
                        experience for our clients:</p>

                    <h2>1. Initial Consultation</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, we go through the evaluation of your immigration application and then we start speaking
                        about your migration objectives. It is therefore important in deciding on the right course of
                        action for your specific circumstance.</p>

                    <h2>2. Strategy Development</h2>
                    <p>After the first consultation, we determine your migration objectives and develop an individual
                        migratory strategy. It draws into consideration issues like your expertise, experience, training
                        and education, and other aspects of your life.</p>

                    <h2>3. Document Preparation</h2>
                    <p>We help in sourcing and compiling all required paperwork. This includes assisting you in getting
                        your <a href="assessment_visa.php">Skills Assessment</a>, English test result, police check and
                        any other documents which are
                        recommended.</p>

                    <h2>4. Application Lodgement</h2>
                    <p>We compile and submit your application accurately to meet all specific qualifications by applying
                        appropriately. The precision at this stage can help to minimize time spent on the data as well
                        as the possibility of a favourable result.</p>

                    <h2>5. Follow-up and Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>In the course of processing, we communicate with the Department of Home Affairs on your option.
                        When there are any additional questions on our part or any other related inquiries we provide
                        you with feedback instantly and also inform you on the progress of your application.</p>

                    <h2>6. Decision and Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>Once we have come to a conclusion then we show you the way forward and what you need to do in the
                        future. If your visa is granted we give you details of your conditions of the visa and any
                        further procedures. Where there’s a refusal, we explain the reasons why and consider another
                        course that is possible to take an appeal.</p>

                    <h2>7. Post-Visa Support</h2>
                    <p>A visa grant does not mark the end of our services for the client. We assist clients in terms of
                        making introductions and giving customers information on healthcare, education and job
                        opportunities in Australia.</p>
