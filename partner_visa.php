                <p class="left">A partner visa in Australia lets a person come, work and study in Australia if the
                    person is a spouse or a de facto partner of an Australian citizen, permanent resident or
                    eligible New Zealand citizen. The visa system is the only way that partners and fiancees who
                    have the need to develop their family lives in Australia can be granted temporary visas at the
                    beginning of their stay and then be given permanent ones further down the line.
                    <br><br>
                    This visa recognises and encourages family integrity, and increases and develops family ties
                    with Australia, highlighting this country’s dedication to multicultural families. It covers any
                    couple who are legally married with a spouse visa as well as those civil partnerships including
                    the same sex. Partner visa is also a two-visa scheme where the applicant first gets a temporary
                    visa (subclass 820) followed by a permanent visa (subclass 821) if he or she meets certain
                    requirements within the temporary visa period.
                    <br><br>
                    This way, Australia avails itself of this visa to maintain family unity and love ones and, at
                    the same time, offer an opportunity for successful integration into Australian society.

                <p class="left">In Australia, applicants use one application for a temporary partner visa Subclass
                    820, and a permanent partner visa Subclass 821. These visas are composed of a two-part sequence
                    with the temporary visa being the first step toward gaining a permanent resident visa. Let us
                    explore the two subclasses in detail:

                <h1 class="left">Partner Visa (Temporary) Subclass 820</h1><br>
                <p class="left">The partner visa can be applied for in two primary categories and thus the
                    first one is called the Subclass 820 Visa. This visa enables applicants to be in Australia
                    temporarily as they wait for a permanent visa decision to be made. The purpose of this visa is
                    to primarily provide temporary status where the applicant expects to gain eligibility for
                    permanent status in the near future. At this time they are allowed to work and enjoy many other
                    privileges in Australia provided they meet certain conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    Nonetheless, with Subclass 820, applicants are allowed to live in Australia while waiting for
                    the partner visa subclass to be processed. This visa takes 6-28 months to process depending on
                    the case a client presents and how detailed the application is. This visa also entitles the
                    applicants to access Medicare – Australia’s universal health care system, work and study during
                    the time the decision is being processed.

                <p class="left">The Subclass 821 Visa is the second and last part of the partner visa categories
                    that allow the applicant to permanently reside in Australia. Once the applicant has proven the
                    continuing relationship and undergone all the legal requirements, the applicant migrates from a
                    temporary Subclass 820 visa to a Subclass 821 visa.
                    <br><br>
                    Further, the Subclass 821 visa enables visa holders to live in Australia permanently together
                    with the privilege of working and studying within the country. Along with full Medicare
                    entitlement, this visa brings social security and a chance to apply for Australian citizenship
                    after meeting living residency. Although times to process the permanent partner visa differ,
                    they usually take between 10 to 26 months within which the applicant must meet the necessary
                    requirements.

                <p class="left">As for the Subclass 820 visa, the couple is required to prove the existence of their
                    relationship. This includes substantiation of finance issues, living together and other socially
                    acceptable documentation that received parties are in a relationship. If applicants are in a de

                    Another requirement of the permanent partner visa is compliance with the law in Australia, and
                    provision of new character reports where necessary. The applicant and their sponsoring partner
                    have to maintain their relationship from the period in which the permanent visa is being
                    processed.

                <p class="left">A partner visa application procedure comprises a number of steps and thus calls for
                    extensive preparation in order to provide the necessary attention to details. Below is a
                    detailed guide to the steps involved:
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <ul class="left">
                    <li><strong>Initial Assessment</strong> <br><br>
                        The first part in the process is to establish whether the applicant and the intended partner
                        qualify for the visa depending on the closeness of the relationship and paperwork to support
                        the
                        relation. This stage applicants should ensure they have all the general requirements for
                        temporary and permanent visas.</li><br><br><br><br>
                    <li><strong>Lodging the Application</strong><br><br>
                        The application has to be lodged through a personalized ImmiAccount on the website of the
                        Department of Home Affairs. All documents have to be provided in the submission process,
                        including the visa application fee which has to be paid. Unlike the Subclass 820 Visa, the
                        Subclass 821 Visa is filed jointly and together with the Subclass 820 visa.</li>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <li><strong>Document Verification</strong><br><br>
                        Applicants may also be asked to provide other documents or sit interviews once they have
                        applied. The Department of Home Affairs will confirm all documents including relationship
                        documentation and character clearances as presented by the applicant. One must make sure to
                        reply to any queries on the matter as soon as possible to do as the requestors of pro forma
                        shall deserve.</li>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <li><strong>Visa Processing Timeline</strong><br><br>
                        The stay in the partner visa application depends on the different circumstances of the
                        applicant. Temporary partner visas (Subclass 820) normally take 6 to 28 months, permanent
                        visas (Subclass 821) take about 10 to 26 months depending on the fulfillment of the initial
                        requirements for eligibility. There is also an option that applicants can apply for the
                        Resident Returning Visa while their spouse visa is still being processed and they can
                        legally stay in Australia on a bridging visa.</li>

                <h1 class="left">Understanding De Facto Relationships</h1><br>
                <p class="left">A de facto relationship may be described as a status where two people cohabit in a
                    genuine domestic partnership although they are not lawfully wed. This type of relationship is
                    acknowledged in the process of applying for a partner visa and entails rigid proof
                    admissibility.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to note that before clients qualify for a de facto visa they must show that
                    their relationship has existed for a period of at least one year prior to the application for
                    the visa. Even here there could be exceptions like the couple has a child and that the union is
                    recognized by a state or territory law.
                    <br><br>
                    To obtain a de facto visa, one needs to provide evidence of residing together, tenancy
                    agreement, utility bills, financial statements illustrating shared expenditure and letters of
