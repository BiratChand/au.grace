                    <p>
                        At Grace International, we provide total assistance in the process of applying for the 482 visa,
                        which is for skilled employees to live and work in Australia for a specific period when the
                        sponsor cannot locate any local talent. The Temporary Skill Shortage Visa enables the employer
                        to submit an application for the foreign skilled worker when they may not be able to find a
                        qualified employee in the country.
                        <br><br>
                        The Subclass 482 visa was launched in March 2018 as a successor of the 457 visa and currently
                        offers an important mechanism for Australian employers to recruit foreign skilled workers.
                        <br><br>
                        The 482 visa program aims to balance the needs of Australian businesses with the protection of
                        local job opportunities. It offers flexibility to address skill shortages while maintaining
                        stringent requirements to safeguard both Australian workers and sponsored foreign employees.

                        understand how important such employees are to the growth of their business ventures. Below are
                        the few steps our team will guide you through.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3><strong>Step 1: Eligibility Check for Australian 482 Visa</strong></h3>
                    <p>The Subclass 482 visa has a few requirements that show the eligibility of the employer and
                        employee:</p><br>
                    <h4>Employer Eligibility</h4>
                    <p>Employers must meet the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be an approved standard business sponsor.</li>
                        <li>Have a genuine position available.</li>
                        <li>Conduct labour market testing.</li>
                        <li>Offer the annual market salary rate.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h4>Employee Eligibility</h4>
                    <p>Prospective employees of 482 visa must have the following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be nominated by an approved Australian employer.</li>
                        <li>Possess at least two years of relevant work experience.</li>
                        <li>Obtain health insurance.</li>
                        <li>Meet health, character, visa history, and English language requirements.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3><strong>Step 2: Employer Sponsorship Application</strong></h3>
                    <p>To become an approved sponsor, businesses must meet the following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be legally operating in Australia</li>
                        <li>Demonstrate a strong record or commitment to employing local labour</li>
                        <li>Not engage in discriminatory recruitment practices</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3><strong>Step 3: Employer Conducts Labour Market Testing</strong></h3>
                    <p>In order to be approved for the 482 visa the employer conducts a Labour Market Testing. This test
                        is done to prove that there are no qualified Australians to fill the position. The LMT conducted
                        should be done not more than 4 months before the nomination is submitted.</p><br>
                    <h3><strong>Step 4: Employee Nomination</strong></h3>
                    <p>For a successful employee nomination, employers must demonstrate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The position is genuine and aligns with business needs</li>
                        <li>The nominated occupation is on the relevant skilled occupation list</li>
                        <li>The salary meets or exceeds the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT) </li>
                        <li>Employment terms and conditions are comparable to those for Australian workers</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3><strong>Step 5: Employee applies for the visa</strong></h3>
                    <p>Once nominated, the employee must submit their 482 visa application, having met all the basic
                        requirements outlined in Step 1. The Department of Home Affairs assesses each application
                        individually, considering all relevant factors to ensure that successful applicants can
                        contribute positively to the Australian economy and society.</p>

                    <p>
                        The immediate TSS (Subclass 482) Visa option permits individuals to remain for a maximum of 2
                        years, or up to 4 years with an International Trade Obligation (ITO). The application fee for
                        short-term 482 visa streams is AUD 1,265 for primary applicants. Processing times for this
                        stream vary but generally aim to expedite applications for urgently needed skills in the
                        Australian market.
                        <br><br>
                        There are renewal options if the occupation remains eligible and there is ongoing demand in the
                        Australian labour market. The short-term stream provides limited pathways to permanent
                        residency, although visa holders may be eligible to apply for other skilled migration visas upon
                        meeting specified criteria.

                    <p>
                        The Medium-Term stream is designed for skilled workers employed in occupations on the Medium and
                        Long-Term Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL) or the Regional Occupation List (ROL).
                        <br><br>
                        The medium-term TSS (Subclass 482) Visa stream enables individuals to remain in the country for
                        a maximum of 4 years, and they have the opportunity to seek either another TSS Visa or Permanent
                        Residency, providing greater stability for both employers and skilled workers. The application
                        cost for this 482 visa stream is AUD 2,645 for primary applicants.
                        <br><br>
                        This stream provides a potential pathway to permanent residency after three years, subject to
                        meeting specified work and residence criteria. Processing times for this stream also vary but
                        are designed to accommodate longer-term employment needs and the integration of skilled workers
                        into Australian communities.
