                <p class="left">The Skilled Independent visa, also referred to as visa subclass 189, is a type of
                    visa that aims to bring in skilled workers who have been invited and possess specific skills
                    required by the Australian community at large.
                    <br><br>
                    The Skilled Independent Visa (subclass 189) is a permanent residency visa for skilled workers
                    who are not sponsored by an employer, family member, or nominated by a state or territory
                    government in Australia. This visa is designed for individuals who possess skills in demand in
                    the Australian labour market.
                    <br><br>
                    The Skilled Independent Visa is for people with the necessary qualifications and skills to
                    address Australia’s skill shortages, and do not have sponsorship from an employer, family
                    member, or government entity.
                    <br><br>
                    If you meet the criteria, you can reside, work, and study indefinitely in any part of Australia.
                    The subclass 189 visa requires a certain level of points based on particular work abilities. If
                    the visa is approved, residents who are invited receive similar rights to Australian citizens.

                    <p class="left">The subclass 189 visa is a type of visa that requires the applicants to meet
                        specific criteria through a points-based system. In addition to receiving an invitation to
                        apply
                        and meeting the skills threshold, there are various requirements that must be met, such as:
                    </p><br><br>
                    <p><strong>Receive an Invitation to Submit an Application</strong></p>
                    <p>After submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI) through SkillSelect, you need to receive an
                        invitation from the Department of Home Affairs to apply for the visa. Invitations are issued
                        based on your points score and occupation, with higher-scoring candidates prioritized.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p><strong>Nominate an Occupation on the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List
                            (MLTSSL)</strong></p>
                    <p>Your nominated occupation must be on the current MLTSSL. This list contains occupations that
                        are
                        in high demand in Australia and are likely to remain so in the medium to long term.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p><strong>Appropriate Skill Evaluation</strong></p>
                    <p>You need to obtain a positive skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority for
                        your
                        nominated occupation. This assessment verifies that your qualifications and experience meet
                        Australian standards for your profession.</p><br><br>
                    <p><strong>Age Requirement</strong></p>
                    <p>You must be younger than 45 years old at the time you receive an invitation to apply. This
                        age
                        limit ensures that skilled migrants can contribute to the Australian workforce for a
                        significant
                        period.</p><br><br>
                    <p><strong>Point Requirement</strong></p>
                    <p>You need to score a minimum of 65 points on the points test, which assesses factors such as
                        age,
                        English language ability, work experience, and qualifications. Higher points increase your
                        chances of receiving an invitation.</p><br><br>
                    <p><strong>English Proficiency</strong></p>
                    <p>You must demonstrate at least competent English language proficiency through an approved
                        English
                        language test like IELTS or PTE. This ensures you can effectively communicate in English in
                        the
                        Australian workplace and society.</p><br><br>
                    <p><strong>Health and Character Requirements</strong></p>
                    <p>You must meet Australia’s health and character requirements, which include undergoing health
                        examinations and providing police clearance certificates. This ensures that visa holders do
                        not
                        pose a risk to public health or safety in Australia.</p>

                <h1>Benefits of Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189)?</h1>
                <p>The Subclass 189 visa offers numerous advantages:</p><br>
                <h4><strong>Permanent Residency Status</strong></h4>
                <p>The skilled independent visa (subclass 189) grants permanent residency</p>
                <br>

                <h4><strong>Access to Medicare</strong></h4>
                <p>Access to Medicare, Australia’s publicly funded healthcare system.</p>
                <br>

                <h4><strong>Work and Study in Australia</strong></h4>
                <p>Holders can work in any occupation and location within Australia. They are also eligible for
                    subsidised or free education for children in public schools.</p>
                <br>

                <h4><strong>Pathway to Australian Citizenship</strong></h4>
                <p>After meeting residency requirements, visa holders can apply for Australian citizenship, which

                            <p> You don’t have to worry about a limited duration of stay because sub-class 189 is a
                                permanent visa. So, you stay in Australia forever if you want. However, there is a
                                travel component under this visa, which states that your privileges to travel
                                outside Australia and return back expires after five years once you get the visa.
                                <br><br>
                                Likewise, on the day you receive your visa, you will be considered a permanent
                                resident of Australia. If you are in Australia, your permanent residency will begin
                                as soon as the authorities grant your visa. Also, if you are out of Australia, the
                                permanent residency will begin on the day you enter the Commonwealth.
