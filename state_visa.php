                <p class="left">The visa costs about AUD4,045 for the principal or primary applicant. You can
                    forecast visa costs using visa cost estimators on Australian government websites.
                    <br><br>
                    Similarly, you must pay additional fees for each family member you add to the application. In
                    addition, if the authorities demand it, you must pay a second installment fee for family members
                    of about AUD4,885.
                    <br><br>
                    The second installment charge is required when someone in the application is over the age of 18
                    or 18 years old but has a limited command of the English language. However, it must be paid only
                    if the authorities decide to issue the visa for such a family member.
                    <br><br>
                    The Visa Pricing Estimator will not contain the charges of the second installment and other
                    extra costs. You might also have to pay additional charges for health checks, police
                    certificates, and biometrics.

                                However, there is a travel component to this visa, which states that the chance to

                                visa.
